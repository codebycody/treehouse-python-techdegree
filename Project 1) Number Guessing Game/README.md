# Number Guessing Game

## Summary
In this project you will build a console game that will let you exercise the skills and concepts you have learned in the unit so far. This game is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game.

Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to Pick a number between some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10". Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.

To complete each part of this project, use ONLY the concepts and techniques we have covered in the courses so far.

## Project Instructions

* Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
* As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.
* As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
* As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
* As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.

## Extra Credit Instructions
* As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.
* As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.
* As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points), so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
